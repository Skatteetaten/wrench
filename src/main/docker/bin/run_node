# We set a trap on TERM so we can have code running after the child has terminated. OpenShift gives an
# error on a non-zero exit code, and the JVM exits with 143 when sent at SIGTERM
# This construct depends on an init-system like dumb-init that signals all processes in the session. If the JVM
# is not signaled, it will not exit, the trap will not run, and everything will hang...
